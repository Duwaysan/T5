This dataset is essential for analyzing patterns and causes of accidents to improve road safety.\n","\n","### Data Characteristics\n","- **Entries**: The dataset contains 12,316 entries.\n","- **Features**: There are 32 features in the dataset, which include:\n","  - `Time`: Time when the accident occurred.\n","  - `Day_of_week`: Day of the week.\n","  - `Age_band_of_driver`: Age group of the driver involved.\n","  - `Sex_of_driver`: Gender of the driver.\n","  - `Educational_level`: Educational level of the driver.\n","  - `Type_of_vehicle`: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.\n","  - `Cause_of_accident`: Reported cause of the accident.\n","  - `Accident_severity`: Severity of the accident.\n","- **Target Column**: `Accident_severity` is used as the target column for modeling. This feature classifies the severity of each accident.\n","\n","### Objective\n","Students will use this dataset to apply various data visualization, modeling, and evaluation techniques learned in class. The primary goal is to build models that can accurately predict the severity of accidents and to identify the key factors that contribute to severe accidents."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"177291c2","metadata":{"id":"177291c2"},"source":["## Import Libraries\n","Import all the necessary libraries here.

Preprocessing\n","Data preprocessing is essential for transforming raw data into a format suitable for further analysis and modeling. Follow these steps to ensure your data is ready for predictive modeling or advanced analytics:\n","- **Handling Missing Values**: Replace missing values with appropriate statistics (mean, median, mode) or use more complex imputation techniques.\n","- **Normalization/Scaling**: Scale data to a small, specified range like 0 to 1, or transform it to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n","- **Label Encoding**: Convert categorical text data into model-understandable numbers where the labels are ordered.\n","- **One-Hot Encoding**: Use for nominal categorical data where no ordinal relationship exists to transform the data into a binary column for each category. (Be careful not to increase the dimensionality significantly)\n","- **Detection and Treatment of Outliers**: Use statistical tests, box plots, or scatter plots to identify outliers and then cap, trim, or use robust methods to reduce the effect of outliers, depending on the context.\n","- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance your dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones. This might involve combining data from different columns, applying transformations, or reducing dimensionality with techniques like PCA to improve model performance.\n","\n","Consider these steps as a foundation, and feel free to introduce additional preprocessing techniques as needed to address specific characteristics of your dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IX1nVvFc89L-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722517399918,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":31,"user":{"displayName":"Khaled","userId":"10230634685242631763"}},"outputId":"78cbcf99-d8a5-4ec2-f2d7-abc774655f26"},"id":"IX1nVvFc89L-","execution_count":568,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 12316 entries, 0 to 12315\n","Data columns (total 32 columns):\n"," #
